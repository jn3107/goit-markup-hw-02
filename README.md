# goit-markup-hw-02

A website of WebStudio company. Project for homework of html/css course in GoIT.

Figma (global): https://www.figma.com/design/Kr5Q4EVrEAqpOWko4QeEJb/Web-Studio-(Version-4.0)?node-id=296708-626&t=7aceuf6ZweDtYN5y-0

Made the page markup, added the CSS-style file, connected the fonts, and used the hover and focus pseudo-classes. I used technical skills: HTML5, CSS3 and Google Fonts.
